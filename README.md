Novena de aguinaldos - video project

This project is designed to build some videos that will be used for having the *Tradicional Novena de Aguinaldos*
(Novena of Advent), a common Christmas tradition in Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela.

Texts are originally written by 18th century Quito-born priest Fray Fernando de Jesús Larrea with modifications
by Mother Maria Ignacia (31 July 1856 – 31 July 1910) in late 19th century.

I am trying to preserve the traditional texts, without _modern_ modifications or adaptations.

Build process and tools are distributed as copyleft, for anybody to complete, add or modify similar projects.
